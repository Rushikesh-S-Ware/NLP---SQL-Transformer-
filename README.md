# 🧠 NLP-SQL Transformer

A Streamlit app that transforms natural language questions into SQL queries, enabling users to explore their uploaded CSV data interactively.

## 📄 Project Summary

**NLP-SQL Transformer** is an intelligent question-answering system that allows users to upload one or more CSV files and ask data-related questions in plain English (e.g., _"How many users are over 25?"_). Powered by a fine-tuned BART Transformer model, it dynamically generates SQL queries and executes them on the uploaded files, returning both the query and the result.

</p>

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload CSV Files** – These are loaded into an in-memory SQLite database.
2. **Ask a Question** – The system constructs a schema-aware prompt.
3. **Generate SQL** – The BART model generates a SQL query based on the input.
4. **Post-process Query** – Applies regex corrections and fuzzy logic if needed.
5. **Display Results** – Executes the query and returns the results in a table.
