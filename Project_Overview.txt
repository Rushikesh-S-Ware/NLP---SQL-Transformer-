## Notebooks Submitted

1. **Model_Training.ipynb**  
   - Implements the end-to-end BART fine-tuning pipeline on the Spider dataset  
   - Saves model checkpoints under `./checkpoints/`

2. **Demo_Notebook.ipynb**  
   - A Streamlit demo allowing:  
     - CSV file uploads → in-memory SQLite tables  
     - Natural-language questions → SQL generation via ONNX BART  
     - Immediate execution and result display  
   - Loads checkpoints from the model notebook for seamless inference
